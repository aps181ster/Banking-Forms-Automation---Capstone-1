# Banking-Forms-Automation---Capstone-1
This project uses AI-OCR to fetch details from the handwritten-scanned bank forms and fills it in the sheet. It also validated the data received in the main form, and if anything is missing, sends a mail to the customer to provide missing info, otherwise sends an acknowledgement mail.
